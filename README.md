## Installation

This extension is available on the [Chrome Web-Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodle-autologin/hlnoapoheegphigdgnaaadilghfecdgh). 

It also works with Firefox, however Mozilla did not yet approve it in their Addon-Store. 
Depending on their final decision, I might distribute a Mozilla-signed `.xpi`-version instead.

## Usage

1. Go to the extension's settings.
2. Insert your credentials.
3. If necessary, accept the addon's permissions.

Now the extension should automatically log you in!

### Notes for Firefox

If your browser is older than version 109, you have to set `extensions.manifestV3.enabled` to `true` in `about:config` to be able to install this addon.
